# Domino Modelling

This repository contains a series of scripts and functions used in the study of 
domino mechanics. The repository is broken into several subsections.

## Analytic Modelling

This folder contains two analytic domino models created by D. Shaw (1978)
and J.M.J van Leeuwen (2004). This folder also contains scripts and functions
created to animate the analytic models. 

## Experimental Data Processing

This folder contains a script to process experimental data. Currently,
all processing is based on audio analysis.

## Finite Element Modelling

This folder contains scripts to process the output of FE models. Processing
scripts are very similar to audio processing scripts, but contain significantly 
less filtering
